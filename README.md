# InterSystems View Container

InterSystems view Container is a Visual Studio Code extension that contributes an icon to the Activity Bar and an associated view container to the Primary Side Bar. This container then hosts views contributed by the ObjectScript extension, Server Manager, and potentially others.

See the [CHANGELOG](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/intersystems-community.viewcontainer/changelog) for changes in each release.
